currency-exchange-rate-analysis

Forecasted currency exchange rates (Nigerian Naira - British Pounds Sterling) using different machine learning models (ARIMA, linear and polynomial regression) and evaluated key metrics

**Libraries**: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, arima, math, statsmodels, auto_arima 

# Project overview and details

- Developed machine learning models to forecast currency exchange rates (Nigerian Naira - British Pounds Sterling) to help economists, policy makers, banking professionals and other financial stakeholders.
- Acquired the raw data from the Central Bank of Nigeria and first cleaned (e.g. typographical errors, wrong formats etc) the dataset to get an initial insight.
- Developed and optimised arima, linear regression, polynomial regression models and evaluated key metrics to get the lowest root mean square error (RMSE).
- Trained and validated the models on the train and test dataset.


# Metrics 
- RMSE for ARIMA: 32.7 
- RMSE for linear regression: 107.3
- RMSE for polynomial regression: 116.2
